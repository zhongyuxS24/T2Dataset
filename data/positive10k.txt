Amazing I like how you don't just go and eat you have to use your mass wisely or else you will be smaller than the one your chasing. Very creative.

Most configurable audio  New UI. The new UI is a vast improvement. It's still a little quirky, but you get used to it quickly. Very configurable and great sound. The developer is very responsive.
Great for comics I think the newest updates fixed the issues the smart lists update introduced. Excellent, really like the new lists and sorting.
Does what it's supposed to do, tell me if I'm properly rooted or not. Was using the free version forever but decided to buy the pro version to support the developer.

Good for those learning Japanese. Its good practice for those that want increased Kanji skills, and also no furigana for most of the series. Anyways, good selection of manga as long as you are able to read Japanese. Stop complaining about no English.

The best so far I've tried most of the other android comic viewers and although this one is basic in many ways that is also its best feature.  The infinite scroll through pages makes this very easy to control.
Awesome A wide variety of games to choose from. I found traditional favorites and new to me. The rules came in handy to learn new or refamiliarize. Inexpensive hours of fun.
Great Use it daily for a dash camera on my G35. Works great Especially if one were to be in an accident Love that it works with my OBDII sensor Totally worth the 5

Tracks and Drivers Need Knoxville, IA for sure. Chad Simpson and Scott Bloomquist is needed. Need for cautions and possibly victory lane. Also the ability to do heats and mains.
really like it but it keeps dying on my phone so I have to keep uninstalling and redownloading. I guess that helps the download number if people hard to download it again and again
Great Very fun, no annoying adds or prompts to buy stuff so is great. Very fun

Good realistic game App works well,  but it would be good to be able to play a full match in this version
Addictive A great little game to fill in time, ie waiting for appointments etc.
Great game,  although I think I enjoyed the simplicity of 10000000 a bit more.  However, I highly recommend both games. Perfect pick up and play type of game. Great time killer
Very good Good good good excellent app good work 9app
More Layers This is by far,the best free app for sketching I found.I give 5 stars,but one little thing I want And I'm sure others want tooAt least 5 layers.Is really hard to work with only 3 layers.

This is so cool You can shoot people and shoot in tanks and ride in tanks and cars Whoa
Cv attachment Why  cant you attach a CV when replying to jobs or how do you do itThx for fixing this issue guys
Graphical For such great graphics out don't take up a lot of room on your device. Fun to watch. There are similar games to this but not quite as appealing
5 stars for the idea It's different, but that's what people like. And to guy that mentioned the diamonds were useless, just remember that Mario couldn't spend his coins in MOST games anyway
Best messaging app ever No lags.. no signing in or out. ..always up to mark... awesome. ...can't think without whatsapp
              
Great app Great app, and it does NYTimes crosswords. My only gripe is that it doesn't use my phone's native keyboard, but that is a minor issue at worst. If you are a crossword addict, get it. Only thing better is paper.
Excellent app Tried quite a few of the competitors and none come close. This is a must have
The Hey lte Das spill hab ich seid kuzen und Das spill ist ssssuuuppppaaa

Ewar I  give it 5 stars .
So far so good Lol looks like we get to criticize your game. Atleast it's not a load of garbage actually rather fun would recommend.
Bugs bugs bugs no more Buttons don't work half the time. And I couldn't finish the game because of a bug. It's a great little game, if they manage to fix it. Edit All fixed now.
Old school jam Plays really good love it 1.23 can't beat it 
Fun I just bought this one and its way better then the free one
Great for learning Its such a great app for kids to learn. There should be more free apps...
.
Level 70 is possible u just gotta keep trying. I beat all 350 levels and once u get to 350, the game keeps ur current score and goes back to level 1. I am on level 180 for the second time around. Great game. I have lots of hours spent on this game.
Super tank battle Cool
Great app... Only issue I had was that the brightness setting came defaulted so low I couldn't read the screen in daylight. Changed setting indoors to match phone brightness, works fine now
OMG so great big big rate's
Just awesome game but when I changed my device I cannot transfer my level and inventory in new device. I don't know why. Can developer team explain me this. Please help me transfer my statistics into new device.
GLITCH I am experiencing a glitch where the boss music during the Ymir fight plays over the background music. It's annoying because I like the boss music and I can't listen to it because of the crappy mine music
Excellent design across the board Clever and elegant translation of the franchise to this platform. Visual and gameplay design is fittingly sharp for a formally slick series, and the boardgame aesthetic particularly clever.
Liv Love  love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love  it
One more go.. Great game but pulling tricks off can be a bit random using the on screen controls. Would love to see some blood when you hit your face into the side of a cliff...

Give option to pay for ad removal or its gone. Another great title. Zero issues running on HTC sensation with custom ics  although I keep data disabled for the most part, keeps ads away I would gladly pay a few dollars for an add free version
I love this game Although there's a bug it happens when the ad comes up every three levels or so which wouldn't be a problem, it crashed the app and saved my level. If you fix it I'll totally keep playing and recommend
Yareli Medina This is the best game

Love it I only wish there could be an upgrade with more mini games. Otherwise, I never thought I could learn Japanese characters this quickly.
No problems I've used this app for at least two years on two separate phones and have found it very accurate. I've checked it against several different vehicles and even confirmed an inaccurate speedometer in a company vehicle.
Cannot get enough Not really a fan of this kind of card game, but I freaking love Tekken Card Tournament, it's so simple, but there is still a lot of tactics at play

Coco's wedding It's wonderful game
The best of its kind Simply the best off road game out there. However it has it flaws... Very few but a couple. The biggest thing is there is never any big updates. 2 add more customization. Great game though and 2 thumbs up
Great App I like this game, but I do wish it had more levels.  And I wish there was another way to get the cheat points beside buying them.  But the game is still good.
Great weather app Nice app, a refreshing company that listens to its customers and follows through with updates and fixes. Thanks for a great app. Keep the updates coming.

Coco wedding Omg omg its the best
Best game ever I love the easy one touch controls. I love how you have to try to guess where the pitcher is throwing the ball. You could add some different bats, as a power up for more power. That would be cool.

Why i cant see all odds
Great game This is the best game on android Cool graphics and music, loads of challenging objectives to accomplish and lots of players, boards and tracks to unlock. Fave game
Educational Most games that require knowledge can be boring but this is interesting, uptodate and fun. There are a few wrong facts I've come across, such as one saying no women have ever been to space, many have but other than that it's amazing.
Awesome I beat it And whats more awesome is...when i searched markiplier, this app came up D

awesome my one year old son loves it
awesome but could be better This game is awesome However I have a request for the developer Could you not make a onoff switch for the 'raining star' effect, it pretty annoys me Thanks
Great but... It's a great game. There are a few bugs though. Most minor but otherwise totally fine. I wish that there was a way to switch guns andor save ammo, even if you could only save ammo in horde.
Wow Very useful...in other file managers ..we cannot delete files and don't copy paste our data but it is very interesting file manager p
So much like the original Love this game. I was worried that it would be different to the original but I'm happy to report that it's just as fun as the original except it now fits in my pocket I might be addicted now.

Amazing game, just wish there was more levels, it gets repetitive after you beat it
Brilliant I trust it completely to choose the quickest way to get to work.  Workes every time. I tried other sat navs but this is the best.

The game is boss but there is a lot of bugs u need to fix like seriously it would glitch and zoom me foward and  stop the game when I'm in the middle of playing it will just pause. And it's not my phone because all my other games work just fine

Don't pay to remove ads There's not a lot of knots here but there's important ones and there is no use in paying to remove the ads for 4.00
Pretty good You can search for lesser known artists like Edgar Allen Poets and SJ Tucker, or go with a lot of main stream music like Children of Bodom and All That Remains. Save tracks you like in a playlist and like and follow different artists.
Awesome game Love, love, love this game The ads are annoying, but overall it's a great game
Awesome Game My 2 year old loves this game so much he will bring my phone to me sit in my lap and activate the game all by himself. Thank you for creating a simple and fun game to teach hand eye coordination

Good game Finally added back to exit. A couple of days to fix an bad update. Honestly it can be better,  but considering that this is done by a small porting company, not bad.
Best crossword app Excellent support.  I reported a problem with one of the updates, had a response within a couple of hours and a fix was released a few days later.  Other app developers could learn a lot about customer service from this company.
So cool apps
Best Android cribbage app This is a great deal.  Free play online, and there's always someone online to play with.
Love it I'll never watch a weatherman on tv ever again
Read below Its really really good but i want it to come out with the second episode and the season pass is too much we just bought the game and now we have to buy the season pass
Throwing Money At The Devs
An impressive port An impressive port that fully utilizes the touch controls of android. Now that they fixed the offline support and it works for the nexus 6 I'm looking forward to many hours of reliving one of my favorite games of my youth.
Lots of fun. Easy to start playing.

Game I love the thought processing you have to do on order to play this game

Gr8t App Love the new material design..
Fun to play . When I can't sleep it gives me something to do. It's. My go to game. .
Really fun Good way to kill time, controls are a bit tricky at first but you get used to them pretty quick Only thing is I'd love for the carsdrivers to be updated for the current season but I doubt that'll happen
Fun Game I love games like this and this does not disappoint I especially like the map that allows for quick travel from one area to another as well as gives a hint about whether or not there are any tasks to do at that time. Thanks
OMG I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH I LIKE IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH
Great but hard Great looking and smooth running app. I play it on like level 3, and it gives me a good challenge. It's been years since I even played checkers. It is a game that is very simple, yet the strategy can be deep.
This game is really fun even if your only playing with one other player. Me and my boyfriend loved this game.
Epic The smartest game in the Play Store. Great atmosphere, best puzzle game ever. 5 stars easily
Great app Very helpful
Great, but... Please please please add native controller support. You can control movement already, but you cant walk, jump, attack, etc. UPDATE You listened Works perfectly with bluetooth controller. Worth every penny. Thanks.
Please update this game..i have completed all the levels and now there is no other stage to fight.it only shows the option titan but there is no way to fight him..please update this game as soon as possible
superb on 4.2.2 TW but slowed my 4.4 kitkat superb.  no more overheat no more battery drain. Much smoothly and faster rom now on 4.2.2 android is excellent..but slowed my kitkat 4.,4
Finally I've been waiting, and it was worth the wait.  My only complaint is that it's too short.  I liked the extra goals in the first epic that this one seems to be missing.
My Daughter My Daughter loves this game she keeps asking fory phone to play
SO COOL This game is fun
Boredom Blaster I find myself playing Angry Birds Space whenever I am bored. I love trying to figure out various strategies for each level. Its a great game.
Mytg She's so fat I need an energy what time I'm going but we beat on one side and V on phone you cry easy pannekoeken show de don omar cartoons about you know who booty poppin in my thirties
Love it Sometimes a little delayed with the updates but only by 10 or 15 minutes. saved me many hours of waiting on a platform
Keep up the good work Really nice app, easy to use, very helpful features e.g. PID combination  exporting recorded data. Works great with cheap ELM327 bought from ebay  china. Looking forward for manufacturer specific PID support.
Just play it One of the best games released for android.
Fantastic game. Nothing to complain about. Challenging but not impossible. Nice graphics
Nice game Fun to play little glitchy at times on the Note 4 but fun.

 Great Job This app is outstanding. Awesome games that are fun to play. B
Funny My little kid loves this game.
So neat for newbies This app is so awesome My kids and i are obsessed, it's so simple that my 6 and 4 year olds can use it with ease. We are amateurs, so we aren't aware of information holes, like a few reviewers mentioned, but it's teaching us a lot
Great way to blow off steam... Because of the fast paced nature of the game, its a great way to blow off steam and wind down from a stressful day...

A unique and pleasant surprise Fantastic weather app Sights and sounds of real weather conditions. I didn't think I would ever gush over a weather app like this. Pro version is well worth the price. Thanks for a great weather app
Elmient Great application..
Impressed. Fairly basic, but it does everything I need it to, which is basically track how much my vehicle is costing me overall. Functional and easy to use... so long as you remember to use it every time you fill up.

Great app Love it easy and simple
Best game I've found Love the racing So much fun
Amazing Everything I look for in a mobile game. Only draw back is that I wish there were hidden items. It would add more depth to the levels and add some replay.
New update I love this game. But the new update is terrible. Getting constant server errors and multiple LUA errors.
Very good Just as the regular game
Perfect transition Loved this it was perfect for a new version the controls feel natural and its already a great game. Now wheres sonic 3

It's a keeper Even with all the crashes frustrating, I LOVE this game Quick question, I updated today on Google Play to 1.8.8. Why does my game still say 1.8.7.24 Crashes are more frequent...

Nice game This game looks pretty

Used to be 1 star It was working, then it stopped. Now it's working like a charm
Addicted.  Totally. It's simple enough to pick up and put down whenever, but challenging enough to keep you hooked  and the levels are designed with just the right growth in difficulty.  I don't play games on my phone often, but this is a keeper.

Perfect app The best flashcard app for android systems. Note that it also saves the packs locally for offline learning if you at least open it once while connected to the Internet. Easier to use the web for creating and arranging cards, though.

Have had it since day one apple and Samsung.  23 is doing a great job.
Amazing Playing PC almost like in VR.  In my case Im having some issues with the sensors of my Jiayu S3, but it seems to be a hardware issue with this phone.  Anyway, Im enjoying a lot playing Halflife again inVR

I always love a well implemented board game, and this one is good.  I have yet to determine how good the AI is, but the challenges are fun and achievements are a nice touch.
Love this one here the most of the solitaire games listed.
 Love it, you should add a few things Suggestions A dog pound where you can be placed when caught and break into, more breeds perhaps Collie's, breeding, tamed dogs, and cars can injure you.
Good game 
So easy to clear errors This app works really well. I am very happy that I don't have to phone in to clear errors anymore.

Lov it Im 30 and love it, so does my 3 yr old son
I wish there was a hard mode Love SU and this game was well worth the money. I only wish there was a way to make it tougher Because I never felt in danger due to all the items I had and the weak monsters  minus the bosses
Great app Great, nofrills way to pass time while waiting in line, etc. Sure, there's the occasional ad...but it's a free app, so quit your whining.
Super Wish

Contrary to reviews It works, it works well, being able to read old issues well worth the admission, I reluctantly just tried it out since it had bad reviews. It's great, goes to show you, don't believe everything you hear.
Yummy cakes I make This game gives me ideas on how to make amazing cakes for parties and other things

This ap is awesome, with very few ads and very entertaining. Also it has very few locked items, and lots of options and toppings to put on your pizzas. My 6 year old loves this ap. Very well done
Love it But u should add a identify so if u brake your phone or get,s wet and u just put your email and password pleas do this pleas it will be helpful because then u have to start all over again to get your guns.
What you want This is the best solitaire app I've found. The cards look like cards, the play is smooth, the ads are not annoying because they do not get in the way of your game, and the achievements are interesting.
Great app, some bugs One of the best investments I've ever made with my smartphone, though the app does get stuck from time to time.

Loved it. This is a very nice app and liked by my son. Few games are very simple and needs more variation but, overall a great app. I have purchased another app from the same people, both are worth of money to me.
Tremendous Fun I've got to say Handelabra knocked it out of the park with this one. The game is very well polished, and has an addictive game play. Don't pass this one over, it's well worth the price.

Asome This game is asome
Worth the money This game may not have all the events available on other games but it doesn't have any problems with downloading and using that I have discovered. It is fun and worth the money.
Very well done. I have enjoyed the game so far. Nice controls, engaging storyline, easy to follow battle system. Jewel synthesizing is a little confusing, but honestly, it just might be me. Overall, a good game with the money
Unit Converter Pro Simple clean design. What it does do it does very well.
City  helicopter game 3D It is awesome

Fun and Time Wasting
I want you to change the game by having baby falcons. But it great.
loved it
Good Good game and with it being challenging, it stays interesting
Best Navi ever No need for Internet connection to find your way, although it can be useful. The only problem is that it stops when crossing borders or losing Internet connection if it was available. Thank you and good job.
Good app for reminders
New update Review Accounts Disabled so i cannot play the game i have paid for 
Cheap and functional In some way, more value worthy than apple music, but curation could do some work
Awesome This was super fun and cute. Even if your not a kid it's a great mind teaser I just finished and I'm in love Great job. Maybe in a later version we will be able to mix the elements
Excellent  Everything functions well. The only issue is the link cable capability being non functional. Other than that this app is perfection.
Great game There are a lot of rooms and easy enough to follow but not too hard to figure out Takes up a good amount of time and I hope there will be more like this
Very good app Yehhh completed 100 level. Too good..
Flow free This game is fun and addicting. I love it. It's very simple. It's difficult at times, but that makes it challenging.
Amazing Love this game, absolutely amazing. The only thing I could think of to make it better is a multi player game where 1 person tries to cure the other person's disease. And an accurate infection rate of animals.
great nice game  love
Good app. Now my son will not have to learn the tabla from his friend.
Excellent Love it
Pyramid Solitaire Saga I would like to be able to see who else has played and their score. I like to challenge myself to beat other player's scores. The game would be even better if you could earn gold bars and other power ups.
I love it. Games
Great app I have to say the developer did an awesome job. Like the app so far. I'm considering on buying the pro version since I like it so much.
Awesome Its a nice game with a wonderful format and very challenging at times
Loved the game
Amazing  This game is super fun to play, its super smooth and just so well made, nothing about it is bad. Good job guys, keep up the good work.
Well...if it wasn't for the soundtrack I would break the phone 55 would rage again
Best thing ever It's so good so buy it so  why look at reviews
My rating Just saying I DID THIS JUST FOR A PRIZE. IT IS MORE OF A 3 12 STAR
Great rally racing game. There is a lack of tracks but I'm not going to mark it down for that as it is a brilliant game with hopeful physics.
The real thing Pity more people don't play. Love the game though.
Friend me Ok on msp im a friendly girl so really im just asking u to friend me my username is Xwassbaby.  So thats my user name luv people who read this and friend me 
Solitaire Game Very fun game and very additive 
Soo good game but should get chances Reaally cool game portal
Instantagram
Best bloons game ever The only downside is the fact you can't make DDTs in MvM. Put it in the MvM research and ill rate 7 instead of 6.
THIS ALARM APP HAS A WAR FACE Thanks Gunny  This app has guts, and that's enough All the bad reviews...  Unless fragmentation has been an issue, its great here, and Gunny is owed one jelly donut.   Seriously, it works great.  Especially for 1.99
Way better I like the graphics but no finger scanner lock screen. Whats the point of showing a picture when its not on here.I don't know what happened but it got a whole lot better.
Amusing little puzzles, some solvable by trial and error. All improbably arranged in the story line. Fun and quick.
Awesome Is easy for kids it should be longer but I love it
This is like really being at a casino with slots.  Fun if slots r what u play
Cars logo quiz HD Fun sometimes challenging
GUESS  THE  MOVIE    CHARACTERS GREAT FOR EXERCISING THOSE MEMORY  AREAS OF THE  BRAIN
Great icons Great, unique icons Great work
How can I download more effects It really is fun, but to get it more awesome, I really wanted to know if this app let's me download more voice effects Please
I love this game it is my most favorite thing ever
Works Ok guys I found out how to get it to work. Grab a small screwdriver and very lightly scrub the surface off of the LED that produces the flash on the back of your phone. This allows it to focus correctly and emit the laser. Enjoy
A title I've been enjoying for awhile now and appreciate the regular updates. These guys are obviously listening to their community because they are doing everything right. No brainer,  5 star.
Nice. You should add different howls. And rival packs with differents howls. And also should add situations inside of the pack
Excellent as usual Reckless racing was one of my first games for a mobile device. I have brought each one since and have enjoyed each one thoroughly. Terrific series and this one definitely continues the greatness.
I love it you take car of 15 different animals and each has a different problem
Been playing since Project Gotham Racing I never get tired of shooting these things. Easily worth 5 bucks. Now make it for 3DS.
This is the one Seriously if your going to have Natsume publish one of your titles and port it to the ps vita or 3ds this has to be the one. Character interaction alone is enough to keep playing this game.
Loved it Very interesting and easy game. It removes stress and our tensions.....
Great App Well priced. The .99 cent Heros are very good. 1010 game.
I  THJS GAME It is so cool I was playing with it four 4 hours
Finally Finally found a good challenging game
Everybody should download if they are big fans of barbie like me It's songs are awesome
Interesting Good to fill time. Has some interesting things to learn about.
Outstanding It's an outstanding game Keep up the good work and current rosters
Great Cool
Request...... I own a few of your full paid versions. Love them all. Any chance of doing a Solitaire card game with that great card style in your other card games
I liked it I hope you can also  injoy it
Love it Love it because help me for whatsapp statuses
Awesome app Probably the greatest gun app out there, amazing dynamics and graphics and rarely glitches up
This game is fantastic I ended up binge playing it till I completed the story hope they come out with a sequel or add more levels to continue the story if you like adventure time you will live this game

Good BUT... It's a very good Game but you can't really do a Groundbreaking Game which everyone likes and plays and buys...
It does what it claims App states no real laser. You dummies 1 starring THIS APP cuz your feelings are hurt NEED TO READ BEFORE YOU INSTALL.
I dont see how people vote this down, i mean ... it's a flashlight. The only 1 stars come from people with screwed up devices. THEY ARNT EVEN REVIEWING THE DAMN APP. 5 stars since it does the job  at giving my friend a sisure
Great app It has very interesting levels but it at some place it is unable to explain how to play
Marine dinos Add marine dinos like lirapluradon ,elasmasaurus, mosasaurus, tylosaurus, and norythosaurus.
Easy and Quick Use Absolutely love this app Extras that are great have been added with no bug issues or slow down issues
Word breaker Love this app.   Very helpful 
Love it I love this game. However, I wish it had a hold button so that you could hold on it like the ones that are in truck stops. It is awesome with the hold button.
Fun game,great graphics
Probably never going to play it I don't really play games on my phone but I had to spend some of my filthy american money to support Yathzee.

A comic book adventure card game I love this game so much, it reminds me so much of the walking dead. And I love the game play mechanics. There are a few bugs, but that cannot stop me giving this game 5 stars.

 It's a good app But it takes awhile to install.
CUTE I adore this app so much Thanks Dr.Panda ltd for making this app
My 6 month old daughter  thinks  these fisher price  games are the best thing ever.
Great I love hidden objects games but most are to small to use on an electronic device. This one isn't like that. Everything is easy to see.
Love the music I hope that vinyl lab will soon release the ost for the game, really nice
A very useful application of my phone's camera and sensors. Fast, easy and accurate.
Love it I fort it was amazing.
love it I like this game cuz I want to be a guitarist and since this is a simulated guitar I can actually be one I don't sound that well but in a few practices I could sound better 
Its grate This is the best game I have ever played and I wouldn't delete it and will not give up come and get some if you dare
Another great game. Wish it would be longer so I wouldn't be finished before the next one comes out. Can hardly wait for the beginning of the first of every month.
Love it I used to hate this game because you couldn't save your game to the cloud, but now you can so I can finally rate this game 5 stars.
Great app This app works great never had any problems records both sides of the conversation can always go back and check what I say or the other person .

Coming back for more The 'guys' are at it again  In terms of quality,  their apps and content rivals those multi billion dollar companies. It takes passion to make a quality product.  They got it in spades.
Favourite 1.Please increase the skill level of the player, it suffocates me every time,  2. It is very disgusting, when my player plays a trump card of opposition team. 3. Needed a Better Distribution system.

Useful, great app Well designed app, intuitive and really useful. Better than relying on the native screen rotation. Simple to customize
Finally can move to SD card Glad that you made this option available. However game still likes to hang for several seconds here and there. Overall game experience is good, but somewhat choppy, even on high end NVIDIA SHIELD tablet.

Best I've Seen Love this app. Very useful. Developer provides excellent support. I really like being able to see the map overlay of the course layout. Very handy if you've never played the course before.
99 Honestly, I enjoy this game and ALL variations so much, sometimes I feel guilty, as if I had stolen it or something. I'd easily be willing to pay at least 5x the price So ridiculously worth the 99

Top rated weather app By far the best weather app.  As good as this app is, it can be improved 1.  Cloud cover overlay is poor. 2.  Needs option to add isobars on map overlay.  Implement the above for 5.  Also,  customer service is exceptional.

AWESOME I LOVE PLAYING THIS GAME EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE AND FUN
Just the visuals alone... I love this so much not just for the visuals but the strategy and the music is phenomenal. Like it's said best with a head set to get the whole experience even for just a minute or two to relax your mind.
I still cannot find the screen with validate on my LG. No problem on any other device. Do you have any suggestions
Fun I love it. It is super fun. Just got it and it works fine for me.

Great game It's really challenging, I hope to see many expansions in the future
Awesome game Game is really really addictive, yes after a certain level you have to pay and it's WRITTEN in the description so before you come and rate it 2 stars because you have to pay, open your eyes and read the description. The money is worth.
love it so much
I love it Brilliant graphics and perfect in every way. Just the game I was looking for. I've already played Dark Strokes 2 and that was just as good. I'd definitely recommend.

Love it
Awesome I almost laughed my guts out on some of these.
Better  than Game Changer Keeps more detailed stats, the only thing this app lacks is an after the game completion article writeup detailing the key points of the game.  Economically feasible for followers and easy to use by the administrator.
Bish68zs This is a great game , IM LOVIN IT. Had so much fun.
Legendary game Played this game many years ago and always thought it was the best Star Wars game I have ever played. Now recently just beat it on Android and I still say it is one of the most amazing games ever

Pinkie pie I love this game I play it every day my mom makes cakes and cupcakes and I think this game will perfect for her

Marvelous I've spent hundreds of hours on this game, very well made, well polished and relaxing.
Awesome An amazing game for everyone there's no problems about it, just apart from the fact that only one of the girls are pretty and the rest aren't.
So Challenging Enjoy it. Great game when you need to kill some time. Make sure you strategize your moves after looking through the deck. All money isn't good money, you make need to count a few cards.
Addicted No complaints 
Fantastic I dont have to go to internet naber and go to webtoon now
Cribbage pro online Great game. Hours of fun.
Good stuff Hopefully more dungeons and creatures on the way, well worth the dosh though for fans of the genre, and plenty of loot

Cleopatra keno Just like the casino game

Great Game Only there were a couple puzzles that didn't make any logical sense to figure out.. You just have to watch video for answer
Oops I only rated it 5 because that way I get 90 coins, other than that, its not horrible... But it's not good. Some characters I've never seen in my life They should make them a tad easier.
Fun Well done version of black jack. Waiting for story mode and local multiplayer.
Great helper It helped my cousin learn now she reads a  book in 15 minutes
Brilliantly engineered Perfectly absorbing and vehemently addicting. Rejoice the time I spend with my friends knocking them out. It would also be a nice option to play online with Facebook, Google friends. See if you can incorporate it.
Best photo app Bought this on a 10 sale but worth full price. Not elegant, but has tons of features. Brilliant
Great free Speedo app Pro version is even better
Htc Lain macam jak

Michael Great program. Exactly what i needed. Works exactly like i want it.

Gigagargantaur To those people who don't know how to kill the gigagargantaur is that you need cherry bombs, squashes, and a jalepeno. Please know that gigagargantaur is more hard than a normal one Also it's defense is tough against peashooters.
Play it everyday Super fun game totally worth the buy. only wish is for fakie grinds and fakie manuals please

Fun Game Easy, fun, thought provoking game.
Cool and active My both children are actively involve since i download this app
Good app for people in doha
Pokmon for your phone... enough said.  Well worth 1.  In app purchases are less worth it, but not necessary at all.
Really fun game Fun game, love playing it. So addictive
Worth every penny Lots of detail and some customisation possible
Great game This game is really awesome. I have lots of fun doing my nails I just wish you didn't have to pay to finish the rest of the hand. Other than that the game is amazing 
Great pool game with killer visuals I have to say that I am very impressed with this game. The physics look very accurate and has plenty of options to tweak out the experience. Keep up the good work guys this is one killer app
Brilliant Matched with a UHS 1 sdcard this works perfectly. If all the apps mysteriously dissappear, I just got to relink all apps and they come back but this rarely happens. If you're getting poor performance and battery life try a decent sdcard.
Good characters Good app, having a lot of fun playing those guys. The only problem is Lincoln who told his brother  Scofield he doesnt want to escape with him lol. Great app anyway, lot of characters and achievements
Nice Different  challenging
Not to shabby I'm very spectacle about trying knock off apps but I'm very happy I purchased this very happy there onto something here and if you are smart you would get it
Nice Customizable controls, fine interface and pleasant reading experience. I tried a lot of similar apps and this one is the best one from my point of view

Awesome game brings back old memories... '
Only problem I have with the game is that when I move a column sometimes cards will break off and go on to a different column than the one I intend to go to, adding more moves to my count.  Otherwise,I love this version of the game.
Great game
Loving it  Theres to many ads but its worth it  because the quotes are really inspirational  
Another fine game It nurtures my inborn need to dominate and destroy my neighbors. It's like digital neighborhood nuclear superiority for Android. You May not see Jesus, but you'll experience god like power. Fun

Word Academy I love this game it is very fun its works out your brain
Angry Birds I love this game. It is alto of fun and the characters are adorable. Those set ups are not easy knock down but fun when you do. Those angry birds are always angry at those pest pigs. Angry Bird is the number game on the apps.
I have a cheat you can use If you don't want your family following you, just feed them and leave the nest before they finish eating. Hope this helped
Its a great way to spend time wisely and actually learn and have fun at the same time . It has beautiful pictures and the scenarios are great. I would recommend it highly to everyone. Best game ever
Love it Would not do without this app.
Amazing in everyway This app is my first jump to digital comics. And I have to say it could not be more enjoyable or easier to make said jump. 1010

Who am I Great game Play this for hours also had to cheat a few times
Galaxy S4 Great shell, smooth fluid and looks awesome,  massively customisable but as much or as little as you want to,  worth every penny 5

Anan Its awesome  Amazing game ... Loved it ..totally addicted ... But i want more money .. Do u have any shortcut to get money and weapons 
What this game really needs in my opinion is two player and each person starts on the opposite side of the planet
Great game Well worth downloading.  You'll find yourself coming back to it again and again.
Really good The game overall looks really good. It does get hard but thats what makes it challenging. Its just like minecraft except its all tower defense. Keep up the good work.
Not really in love with it.... But I have faith the developer's will make this into an awesome game, alot of the ideas from the commenters are really good.
My daughter like soooooo much

Berry gud Very good
News It is really amazing apps where you have all the news on your fingertips.  But from the last one week the apps is not responding.  I am feeling very sad after repeated trying to open but no avail.
I love this game but I hope they add more characters and vehicles in the demo version
Excellent App. Highly recommended application. I used extensively with SIP service and it works perfect. Monzer George Yazigi
Best game on android This is with all honesty the best game produced on android yet. Amazing graphics, retrostyle fighting, funny comments like heck, alternative endings and ways to play. No need to paytoplay. That's a massive bonus.
Simply the best If you want simple simple stuffs, then look somewhere. But if you want more power,control and everything. This is the answer. The more you learn, the more you'll like TASKER. I PROMISE

Mast hai Superb.

Great aproach to the alien invasion Plays smooth and flawlessly on my galaxy note 4, if you liked the console or the pc version, then you are absolutely going to love this app,  5  no doubt in my mind.
This is a great app All of the art is just so pretty and I just love the variety of different people who are in this app. One thing that could use work... some of the videos are not clear and are hard to see. Otherwise great app.
Basketball LOVERS It's amazing I love everything about the game. Great game for everybody
Solitaire by brainium Got to 790000 points and the sucker wouldn't play anymore, said 'forced to stop'. Who knows what that means  Great time waster

Amazing I absolutely love it Lots of fun and actually helped me learn a few songs, great if your a visual learner or can learn by ear well.
Ovoo I loved yayyyyyyyyyy
Everyone Reviewing This Is Stupid The description clearly tells you the app does not allow you to use an actual laser. Its your fault for downloading it and being so stupid for thinking you can make a green laser using your phone. Lol just stop.
Dude I don't like to play games on my phone but this game is just way too good. 5 minutes turns into 3 hours easy.
Great game for a great price This game was so amazing that I bought the second one after a mere 3 minutes of playing. Only downfall...is it is so much fun that you will be compelled to play it until it's over and in turn, makes the game seem short.
Fun Lots of cool options and practical. Comes in very handy for entertainment or emergencies. Quite useful.
This is an amazing watch face. It's both beautiful and simultaneously informative. The only problem I have with it is that it switches to ambient so quickly I can't always take in everything it's displaying.
It's like stepping into 1998, but this time it looks nice. This game is from the same people who make DiRT, so you know it's good. Classic arcade racer that will provide hours of hooning nonsense and pure fun rallying
Loraine I love this cause it help me know how to get make up and fashion some dress
Moon at my fingertips As a tour guide and a photographer I can check in an instant what moon phase we have. I can also use the app to explain to guests how it all works

Addicting Reminded me of Riven and Myst games of the past.  I don't usually play mobile games, but really enjoyed this.  Looked great on my LG Optimus phablet.  I didn't use any of the hints and it was the perfect level of difficulty.

Brilliant I've never seen something like this before. When I first opened it I was not expecting to get what I did. The way the different materials interact with one another is so hypnotizing and I can't explain why.

Good game but... Has some serious lag issues when lots of stuff is on the screen or changed by the player. I'm talking a drop of 80 in frame rate. Other than that very fun and devs seem to update frequently.
Great time waster that does not need 's spent to enjoy. Lots of poker games to play and trophies to win
Brilliant app Keeps phone memory clear well worth having
My daughter and all the kids love this app
Top app This app is the best if it's kind. My only issue is that it needs to cover more cities in the UK.

The kids love it I'm downloading this Doc Mcstuffins game to my phone now so they'll quit fighting over my tablet. I was optimistic because of the bad reviews but it works great and has kept the kids entertained.
Really useful app. It's easy to test different drafting strategies and scenarios and I like being able to tag players to target or avoid. The timer function keeps me honest and is good for simulating the stress of a real draft.
Love this app I use it to take minutes at meetings. It comes in so handy, and makes the task a snap

Great for 2 year olds. The games are a great range for toddlers. My child will be able to use this app for a long period.
Challenging enough to stay interesting A lot of games are either too easy or too difficult, and neither of those extremes are fun. I like this one because it's challenging but not frustrating.

This is way better than I expected Don't fool yourself, this isn't a kid's game. This is by far, one of the best puzzle games I've ever played. It puts so many new elements on a classic puzzle game style and uses the touch screen perfectly
Skills Good app for meeting new people
Love I love this game... Fun with friends. Scoring high score again and again is fantastic. 
2.5 yo loves this My son loves this app.  At first he had trouble but it has helped to teach among other things, patience.
Even more awesome I love this game. I used to be obsessed with the plain angry birds,  but after a while it got boring.  But this one is way better, you don't get bored of it. I love this one more than any of the other versions of angry birds.
Needs an update Good game but needs an update. You should update the game and add all the vehicles into at least one level each and then more people would play and i mean FREE.
Please fix. Hello I really like this application but it makes be keep choosing what launcher to use when changing to another screen or closing a application. Even with the app for fixing this issue. Thanks Thanks for fixing all the issues.

Marjhong Master Fun to play the different configurations you can choose  I most enjoy the alphabet and the numbers, but others are fun too  Easy to play and you can always stop and replay if your time isn't fast enough for you
Brilliant Absolutely brilliant. Great upscale of graphics, great gameplay and soundtrack. Only one thing I would like and that's for the game to be in full screen mode.
Best game ever 1010
Great The app is great. I would only suggest adding the 200m dash and the 4x400m relay. That would make the game 6 stars.
Gooood

Best I have found
wow ok
Nice Awesome short stories..I like this app.
Play it all day everyday Its a nice game but damn challenging in a way because the stages are difficult without neccessary tools man, only if you guys could add more cities. But then i think it would be nice if you add maybe a jungle missions.

Thanks for this I love it it is wonderful things it's better than any nail salon  its amazing, awesome, and flitterific
Its great I love it  Its very scary. Here is how my friend plays it and its the easiest way just put on your mask and wait It is boring that way... I just dont like the fact that you can play only one night .
Great app It let me play my game that I always wanted to play.
The first one was great but this one is so much better. I can't put it down. It's very well made and really addictive. The tricks looks so real. Great job 
Great, perfect I'm always for freebies and I can't fault it, some free often hold up for ads, not so in this case. I'm running Intel quad core 2.16 GHz and no glitches,download and try beating your time before trying against family or friends.
It's a light.
The game is very close to reality. The movement of the coins is very accurate. The beginner, intermediate and expert level players give a feeling of playing with a real person. I have not explored all the features. Over all it deserves a five star.
Love it Thank you

Great App  Plugin's But Still Lacking Audio From Video Support  You Still Have To Convert  Jet Audio Is Still Lacking The Ability Of Scanning For And Playing Audio From Video And Power Amp Has That Ability.

 My son just turned two two months ago, and this has done wonders for him. He already recognizes all the letters in his name and can read mom and dad
Great Game Excellent art and game mechanics make it just like playing in a comic book. Music really puts you in the moment.

It's fun It's fun you get into it you always try to break your last  score  it's a good game.
Amazing It's a great strategy game that actually works the mind. I'm seeing a ton of complaints with the aiming but I've had no problem with that aspect at all. Overall, great game.
Cool This is one game that i don't mind giving a good rating too. Three modes, all fun, no ads either. Best cooking game ever. Hooray my new addiction.
Helpful Its help us tooo much really..
Well... It's not bad, I just don't see the point. I think this has potential, good animations and sound, just no point in sitting there doing nothing but tapping five pictures and watching an animation of a stick figure being murdered.
Super fast mock drafts Easy to test out different draft strategies. Love that I can revert my picks. I got an A grade on my first mock draft so maybe I'm ready to dominate already, lol.
WOW This game is amazing   The sounds are great, the jamming animation is cool, the model of the guns over all are great
Works great for my ps3 no lag its clean gameplay
Awesome Very interesting and fun game I love it  It is probably best to go over the rules briefly, then play for a bit, and then reread the rules.
It does not work super well wuth the Samsung galaxy but the show is so outstanding,  it's worth putting up with the kinks.  I would probably use the app more if it worked better.

AR mode malfunctioning As per some of the reviews, the AR mode does not seem to work any more, it starts to skew when I turn around to view the other compass directions and the horizon no longer matches. Please fix.

A superb app uniquely designed and equally enjoyable. The sole gripe I have though is that some of these associations are rather debatable. I think there is room for some change here... But otherwise you deserve a pat on the back
Fantastic I loved it but the only thing they need is to add more lvls
Xperia Z Ultra This weather app is nice. I have it on my screen but it would be even nicer if the weather emblems such as the sun and clouds we're animated.

Blackjack Good
Solitaire I like games released by Brainium Studios.
Awesome game This is the best game ever, it takes time to move up the ranks in this game. The people who say it sucks or are hating clearly don't know how to play. Keep up thr good work.

Request to add internet speed informer while using internet on phone on corner of the screen.
Brilliant port of a brilliant game Top notch. Well optimised with tight controls and beautiful graphics. Good level of difficulty  not so hard that you give up, but hard enough that getting three stars on every level is set to be a real challenge.

Good game Graphic is good. Puzzles are difficult sometimes but the hints can really help.
I like this Double U Casino app. This app is somewhat different than the Double U Casino played on my computer but it plays very well...and no glitches on either my nor my husband's phone  Androids.  We're both glad we downloaded this app.
GOATSIM I am a big fan of the most advanced goat stimulator technologies in this game, 910 only because you guys could have added things like super amazing 1v1 MLG online RPG wars whilst using a jet pack so add that and you will get unlimited kudos
Amazing Beatiful pokemon mini I love it would definatly day it's worth the money

Sleeping The game is awesome. But when her sleeping is on 100 then you play a mini game for a little bit then her sleeping is like on 53. So everything else is good. But who can get 450 gems lower the price of things in the wardrobe
It's good
         
Good game Hold your horses. .. spend some time. . Practice. . And then you would find it hard to quit

Fine Super
Better than ever. Smooth operation. Pleasant to play without being too easy or to irritating.
This game is spectacular I am a huge fan of the physical version of this game,  and the designers of this digital version did a spectacular job of rendering the game just as playable and fun as the original.

Modern taxi driving It's really fun they should add more things though
Addictive Better than the standard match 3 games. Looking forward to number 3
Solved my issue, on LG Gpad LG VK810 having issues greenifying, so I purchased this and installed Xposed Frameworks and everything works fine now. The 7 day refund was comforting knowing if it didn't work the developer stood by his app. Kudos to you.
Thanks for the app and I am humbled Thanks so much for the app is not a problem with the same time as well
Crashing Please fix for nexus 4 and 7 running the new android 5 lollipop.  Immediately crashing when started. Update The update fixed the problem.  Thanks
Superb brain fodder Enjoy this app LOTS, stops  makes u think not so much on the words u can see, but also where the tiles will fall to make new ones, almost akin to chess. The sound tracks not to shabby either, cheers peeps keep up the good work.
Best game ever I love this game so much the only thing i think they should fix is on my s5 sport it is kind of glitchy but everything else on it is the best game i could play it all day
Perfect

I absolutely adore this game. I'm missing one of the red gems though, but I have a key for 53, I believe. I've looked in all the locations that I've read in walkthroughs, tried every option, found every store and I'm still lost.

Highly recommend First and possibly only Android Wear face I've purchased. Looks fantastic, and highly customisable. Passive mode screen, watch and phone battery levels and a range of weather options mean this gives me everything I need at a glance.
AIS for the rest of us When we are crossing on our sloop in the Chesapeake and along the eastern seaboard, this app gives us the identity of the big ships we want to hail. It is a huge safety win for us, without the high cost of installing AIS.

I used ur free app..love it  so i bought the pro.  thnx for a quality product

My Favorite App. Period. Flights, rental cars, Open Table reservations, show tickets, lodging, golf starting times.  All of the hassle of keeping track is gone.
Son loves it. My 3 yearold loves this game, as well as all the other Dr. Panda games. They seem very well made, and the graphics are cute.
Surprisingly good I definitely approved of the gem system and the fact you can earn the currency you need to get things instead of stupid micro transactions. Bravo.
Ok now every were is westeland Nothing to say
Complicated menus Great app BUT the menus are complicated and most of the features are hidden from the menus and only exist as isolated activities with no button to access them from the main menu. If this is fixed I would give 5 stars.
Loved it I love nicki Minaj. She is my idol after Michael Jackson
Very cool Now I can know if my girlfriend doesn't trust me,  great app better then the rest....

Really good I can't believe that regular people can have this app for such a low price. I somehow took a picture of what I was looking at and cannot find out how to do it again.
Cats dream
Its challenging Its hard, the last level, I can't defeat ice king, I dunno how to defeat ice king

Crashes when battling for too long. Please, create a feature to save inside a battle. As the battles tend to last very long, and it is in a mobile, saving in a battle would be very handy.

Great App Exactly as advertised and easy to use. Has bells and whistles if you're into that, or just simply works as a flashlight.
Excellent Car Mode App The extant issues with screen orientation and dock switching are entirely Google's fault,  not the developers.

What fun It has been quite some time since I've found a game that was this intellectually stimulating. The clues help if you get stuck, but I try not to use them. All around a great game, a must have
Great board game. Even greater board game app. Love playing this. Campaign is fun with wellwritten tongueincheek humour. Challenging and addictive. My brain has now begun sorting connectable space pipes in my head while I'm not playing it...
Wedding dash Awesome game works good.  Freezes alot Wish this could be fixed So worth the money though. Frustrating to keep shutting it down and restarting my tablet everytime it freezes.  Will give better ratings when issue is fixed.

Toy blast Fun game but u can change the wheel where u can spin two times a day then one gave u more bonuses an a chance to win money.do some changes thanks.
Takes me back to '98 with old MS Games. Works great, backgrounds can be changed and there are many difficulty options. Well worth the dollar for all the replay value. You guys are probably my favourite developers
Much better now This version works much better, the bugs has been fixed and the algorithm seems much better.
This is worth a try and good time pass I usually don't play games but tried this one and I would say is just nice time pass to get away with free time
Billy Bancroft Love to play this . releases stress
The Very Definition of Badassery Man, this game is awesome. I've had it ever since 2011
The Best App I've had for the purpose I like how there is no unnecessary clutter in this app. The dashboard does what it supposed to do. No junk.  Only one to enchance is the accuracy of the odometer it's around 5 or 5 I find.

Painting and drawing for kids Very very nice. I enjoy painting.
It's OK I guess but it needs updates LIKE MAKING YOU NOT DIE ON THE WATER SLIDE but its still a good game
Nice way to improve Great opponent
It's unique I love this game because it has silly choices like the sticky hand and it has a lot of video game references
I would have preferred a Chibi version like FFIV over the FFD RPGMaker treatment.  However, the game is great with a lot of replay value due to the class system.
Best game ever ..... It gets challenging but I still can pass them.
Great talking friend My kid loves this game
Good game Full entertainment
Claire howard  just loves this game its my favouritr

The force is strong with this game I find this game, really fun. It gets really challenging, once it hits the golden stages. Its fun, as well addictive. Although, once you finish it 100, it can get boring
Great for laughs I absolutely love this app. It allows you to create some really laugh out loud moments. Thanks for listening to my feedback concerning removing the 'comic strip it' logo on my finished comics.
Very Useful Easiest way to find trains in Italy, even easier than the web. Options to add  trains to the calendar and save timetables are great.

Great Educational title From my short time perusing the app, this looks like an app the little one will have fun playing and learning at the same time. I will further observe while the little one plays and add more to the review later.

Derf Love yathzee, cool app, but it needs to give you more time to undo moves. Plenty of times  I accidentally hit the wrong slot on the scorecard, does not allow enough time to undo my infraction Very frustrating on a good roll

Love it. It's a real challenge , don't give up... you can win big.

Bookworm meets Candy Crush Only the timed levels are hard so far, but they're all fun.
It is the best I was playing with my little sister and baby cousin
Works well enough. It's accurate and that's what counts. However, it generally heats my phone up more than even Sygic, and has tendencies to lag a lot after about 30 minutes to an hour of use until it is closed, cache cleared, and reopened.
I love the music The game is like Mario brothers gone metal
DP you are da best.Pound it,noggin

I think it's pretty cool U get to go into the past and see old matches like stone cold vs the rock

Loved it Ky little brother said it was cool it is cool
Awesome This is a really challenging game if you get past the first levels. My only criticism is to make the color packs free. Sure, make some of the boards paid, but the colors Fine. Have my nickels and dimes.

Awesome way for my friends and I to compete with each other.
This was great I love these kinds of games. It's a good thing they give you a map and tell where to go on it though, or you'd get lost in all the different areas. If you liked The Room, you'll like this one.
Love it This game is almost perfect, there are plenty of levels so you won't get bored easily and there is a good selection of tracks and cars. I only have one criticism which is that tarmac seems to react in a weird way.

Very nice and intuitive Very good design, looks and pleasant to play. The only cons. is the adds, but that's the reason it's free
Good about about times About time this app came.out 
This is pretty cool Hey. This is a cool app, but I think the only use for it is if your remote is broken and you don't want to buy an other one, or if your super lazy, and  you like to stare at a screen for everything. A cool app, but kinda useless.
Good Able to know more
I don't even know what genre this game is... but I love it I love how the creators just mashed up a bunch of types of games and made it into one super game
Finally I asked you guys to make a euchre game like a year ago and you said you were considering it already... and here it is  Looking forward to many lost hours of sleep and productivity.

Hilarious and fun If you love zp as much as i do, you'll enjoy the humour, the subtle and not so subtle references to the show and the hilarious little gameplay interruptions that keep throwing novel and funny scenarios at you. Recommended folks.

Lekka I haven't even played the game and I'm rating it 5  coz I'm dronk and I'm south African
Excellent Of course, it's only as accurate as the GPS in your device.  A cold start sitting still is usually wrong with any app. The default layout is great, haven't felt the need to change anything yet.
I lost all my progress and upgrades to my towers. Spent real money. I would appreciate it if you reimbursed me all the coins I bought before I bought the premium version. Now I have nothing. Please help
Ke Yeah cool
Stratego Boy, what a solid well made game, this sure brings back memories, but now I can play the A.I. instead of a human adversary. Includes a tutorial for a refresher or in case you're new to this game, also has different difficulty settings.

Live Score I'm loving it. I hope the developers can add Formula 1 and Golf to the list of sports.........please
Jeopardy is a Classic choice Easy gameplay, customizable avatar, easy to follow instructions. And you can turn off the annoying music if it gets to be too much.

Perfect My daughter likes this game very much.she always plays this only. Perfect,exellent
Cars Fantastic app
Nice watch After a quick reply from the developer everything is working as it should. Weather seems inaccurate but that is the fault of the weather service and not the app itself. Changed my review to 5 stars

Interesting game I think a lot of the bad reviews are coming from people who want to be spoon fed the answers. The movie pictures are clever. I really enjoy this game, it's fun and challenging but not frustrating.
Looks to simple. Don't be fooled. Kinda easy then BAM It was tragic when I needed to use a clue. Can't put it down.

Awesome Can't stop tinkering with it. Every single details put in this app is worth the money. One thing can be improved is the addition of folders. That will be much cleaner and easier for us to use.
its fun but... it just wants me to pay for missions and some of us don't have a credit card
Love it

Beautifully made game... I really do love puzzle games like this that really allow you to use some processing power of the mind... Not like all these accessible games they have pouring on the market now.
Great app,  great cause Great app.  One thing which would be good to add would be the ability to take a photo of Shaun from directly in the app like the Gromit app
Awesome games, it glitches a little but still awesome.

Sonic still got it Christian Whitehead don't stop on what you're doing and keep making the best versions of everyone's favorite blue hedgehog
Love it but dont expect to get far Was great at first....then i tried TWICE to buy gems....accepted payment  received no gems. Had to get refund. And without being able to buy gems for help, you can't get past level 35
